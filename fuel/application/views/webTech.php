		<h1>Website Framework</h1>
		<p>The CodeIgniter MVC Framework is used on this site for routing and controller functions.  Databases are MySQL.</p>
		
		<h1>Integrated Technologies</h1>
		<p>This site shows my experience as a Software Developer, Technical Writer, and Engineer.  I have professional working experience with PHP and Node.js on the backend
			and Vue.js and Semantic UI on the front end.  Slim3 PHP MVC framework was used which is like lightweight Laravel with composer dependency management.  This site 
			includes Laravel coding I've done, as well as, React.js and Angular.js which are both similar to Vue.js in terms of being based on modular Node.js.  Included is also React with hooks and Vue 
			3.0 Composition API (which has lifecycle hooks).
