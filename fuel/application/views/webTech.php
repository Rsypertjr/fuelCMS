		<h1>Website Framework</h1>
		<p>The CodeIgniter MVC Framework is used on this site for routing and controller functions.  Databases are MySQl.</p>
		
		<h1>Integrated Technologies</h1>
		<p>This site shows my experience as a Software Developer, Technical Writer, and Engineer.  I have recent working experience with PHP and node.js on the backend
			and Vue.js and Semantic UI on the front end.  This site is hosted on Digital Ocean Droplets. Here is the <a href="http://159.65.100.7/fuel2/index.php/front">Website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Rsypertjr/fuelCMS/tree/fuelPF">Git Repo</a>
		</p>
		<p>One droplet is Ubuntu 16 with nginx server utilizing Express.js/Node.js application framework.  It has an application using Pug templating, Bootstrap, 
		   Mongo/Mongoose document-based database, Nodemon, Pm2, NPM, and other technologies. Here is the <a href="http://206.189.211.36/">Website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Rsypertjr/expressnode">Git Repo</a>
		</p> 
		<p>This site is mostly hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet containing Ubuntu 18.04 LAMP setup.  Fuel CMS framework, Bootstrap, JQuery, JQueryUI, SVG, XML, CSS are the main 
		   technologies uses.  Some Vue.js can also be found.
		</p>
		<p> I updated the Amino Acid Sequence Analyzer to use Vue.js for dynamic front-end performance and Bootstrap-based tables with Paging, Search, and other features for results reporting (<a href="amino">See Mini-Motif</a>)</p>
		<p>A lot of JQuery is used including some JQuery UI (<a href="frontCMS">Old Front Page</a>).  The old front page uses a lot of CSS transformations including 2-D and 3-D.</p>
		<p>JQuery Mobile (<a href="mobile">Responsive Mobile App</a>) is also here.</p>
		<p>Bootstrap is used on the current front page. (<a href="front">Bootstrap Front End</a>)</p> 
		<p>I also use SVG (Scalar Vector Graphics) with DOM (Document Object Model) on the Orominer projects, with recursive iteration for updating data and display. (<a href="orominer1">Orominer1</a>, <a href="orominer2">Orominer2</a>).</p>
		<p>A little coding using Laravel, Angular2 and Redux technology for centralized management of immutable application state is also present. (<a href="front#frameworks">Frameworks</a>)
